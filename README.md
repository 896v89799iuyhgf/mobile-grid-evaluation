mobile-grid-evaluation
======================

The purpose of this project is to evaluate various off-the-shelf grids to determine how well they work
on mobile devices. To achieve this goal, we have defined a simple set of requirements for a fictitious
page showing stock positions in a portfolio. See below:

![Mobile Grid Requirements](https://raw.github.com/archfirst/mobile-grid-evaluation/master/docs/mobile-grid-requirements.png)

Here's a more "official" set of these requirements:

1. The page should have five sections
    * Header: Formatted as "\<Framework\> | \<Grid or Approach\>"
    * Selected position: Position that was last clicked/tapped
    * Table header: Fixed, should not scroll
    * Table body: Positions from the supplied data file (data/positions.js), allows scrolling.
    * Layout info: Shows which responsive layout has been selected and window size in pixels
2. Look and feel should be as shown above.
3. Gain and Gain % numbers to be formatted as in examples below:
    * Zero or positive: $35,000.00 - in gold color
    * Negative: ($35,000.00) - in red color
4. The table should adapt to the height of the device/browser window, taking up all the available
space between the fixed sections above and below it.
5. The table should adapt to the width of the device/browser window, showing the most important
columns that can fit in the available width. For the purpose of this exercise, assume three layouts:
    * Wide (900+): Show all nine columns
    * Medium (500-899): Drop "Total Cost" and "Gain" (show 7 columns)
    * Narrow (0-499): Drop "Symbol", "Price Paid" and "Gain %" (show 4 columns)
6. In case of a mobile device, the table should respond to orientation changes and conform to the
requirements described above.

If you would like to include other grids as part of this evaluation, please implement the requirements
and send us a pull request.
