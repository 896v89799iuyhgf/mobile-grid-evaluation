mobile-grid-evaluation
======================

The purpose of this project is to evaluate various off-the-shelf grids to see how well they work
on mobile devices. To achieve this goal, we have defined a simple set of requirements that should
be implemented for each grid under evaluation.

The folder structure for this project consits of several sub-folders, each focused on a particular
approach or grid to implement the requirements.
